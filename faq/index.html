It’s a tricky number to keep track of, but it’s a great feeling knowing we’ve successfully matched so many people already. We only take on clients who we can guarantee introductions for, and we will turn away people if we do not have the right people to introduce them to. We stand by our name when it comes to introducing good, single people. We check in after first dates, and have a 90% success rate for first time meetings. This means that 90% of feedback after a first date is positive. There may be no match there, but the client has agreed with who we have introduced them to.

(See contract for details) We meet at a cafe close to you, so you don’t need to take two hours off work. The meeting usually takes 45-60 minutes. We believe in quality. We are not a date-a-week style agency. We meet with every single client who wishes to join and check photo I.D. No exceptions.

This paved the way for Two’s Company, after seven years of matching people to briefs. Passionate about starting her own business, Sasha’s partner suggested she start a dating agency. She loved the idea. &#39;I researched what people loved about the current agencies, what they hated and opened Two’s Company using those answers.&#39; And so, Two’s Company was born.</div>

We introduce you to people who fit as much of your initial brief as possible, then after a few dates we might finesse your profile, or you may have found a great match.

If your employer decides to send you to Asia for six months, easy – we’ll just put your profile on hold.

We want to make sure we pair you with someone who’s at the same stage of life as you, someone who shares common interests. At the end of the conversation, we will be able to tell you if we think we have the right people to introduce you to. You can then walk away and make your own decision in your own time.</div>
