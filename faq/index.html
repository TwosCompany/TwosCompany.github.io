Firstly we have at this stage (2014) about 33 marriages that we know of and about 160 couples that are still in relationships who we have introduced. Again, this is only what we know of, we suspect the number to be higher for both cases. Secondly we only take on clients who we know we have people to introduce them to. We turn away people who we don&#39;t have the right matches for. What we guarantee once we have said we can take you on, is that we can give you the opportunity to meet good single people. We cannot guarantee chemistry or attraction. We are the only agency to do follow up after every first date. If you can say to us on the follow up &#39;nice person, I can see why you introduced us&#39; then that is counted as a success as that&#39;s all we can promise. So going on that formula our success rate is in the 90%.</div>

Our problem area is the 55&#43; age group as we have more women approach the agency than we do men. Therefore we turn away a lot if women in the 55&#43; age group - purely so we can keep a balance of men and women. It breaks my heart but it has to be done to be fair to those already on the books. However we still meet with everyone who wishes to join and let them know if we have the right people to introduce them to at the end of the meeting.</div>

It was full on work and matching people to a brief. She did this for six years before deciding she wanted her own business. It was her partner at the time that suggested opening a dating agency at which she thought, &#39;That&#39;s a great idea. I researched what people loved about the current agencies, what they hated and opened Two&#39;s Company using those answers.&#39;</div>

As long as the clients are happy with the quality of people they are being introduced to they will keep meeting people until they have met the one. Two&#39;s Company introduces you to people that fit the brief we talk about at our first initial meeting (more on that later.) Then after a few dates of getting to know each other, if there is chemistry between the two people, great! If not, then we will look at the next introduction. I don&#39;t think anyone can foresee chemistry - it&#39;s up to the two people involved, so, trial and error. If you have not met &#39;the one&#39; in the first 4 introductions - you can choose to have 3 more introductions at $150. Obviously you would only do this if you were happy with the standard of the first 4 people we introduced you to. Our job is to give people the opportunity to meet other single people who are looking for the same things. The rest is up to them.</div>

The contract states that Two&#39;s Company has 12 months to fulfill its obligation of 4 introductions, however, Two&#39;s Company gives the client as long as they like to take all 4 Introductions.

This is where we discuss your &#39;brief&#39;. We talk about you, what stage of life you are at, what you want out the future and obviously what you want out of a partner. At the end of that conversation we can tell you if we have the right people to introduce you to and you can then walk away and make your own decision in your own time.</div>
