This may seem like a funny time to be meeting new people, however it might just be the perfect time.

Keeping safe doesn’t have to mean being isolated. No, we are not allowed to leave our bubble, but if you are single and wanting to meet someone, it can still happen.

As my clients know, I am big on people not judging someone after one date. We have a two date ‘encouragement’ because this gives you time to get to know someone. How they think, how they form their thoughts and opinions, how they treat themselves and others. Not just basing whether you can have a relationship with someone on looks alone.

We all know chemistry and attraction are important, but when I meet with clients they ask me for qualities way deeper than looks and these do not often come out on a first date when you are both racked with nerves.

So now you have the perfect chance to get to know someone, not based just on face value.

Start chatting and getting to know each other, and if you’re getting along, organise a “video date” with Skype, Zoom or FaceTime.

This is some feedback from a first date last week . . .

> *"Wow,
D and I had our Covid-19 Zoom date tonight and it was great - two hours talking and laughing.
Thanks for the introduction, I will stick with seeing where this goes with D.
Thank you
M"*

What a great way to break the monotony!

If you are interested, we can set up a video meeting between you and I to see if we have the right people to introduce you to. You can either start ‘meeting' people straight away, or hold off till the lockdown is over. The meeting is no obligation and you only pay when you are ready to go ahead.

The current crisis is Mother Nature telling us to slow down and play the long game. We are so use to instant gratification that we can often miss out on opportunities that are right in front of us. We just need us to slow down enough to see.

If you are interested click [here](/contact)  to send me an email to find out more.

Stay safe, keep well and have some fun! [Contact us now](/contact)
