description: "You can make an appointment any time you like. We come to you and meet in a cafe close to where you work or live and chat over a coffee. This is where we discuss your 'brief'. We talk about you, what stage of life you are at, what you want out the future and obviously what you want out of a partner. At the end of that conversation we can tell you if we have the right people to introduce you to and you can then walk away and make your own decision in your own time."
