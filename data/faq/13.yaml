description: "You can make an appointment any time you like. We meet at a cafe and chat over coffee. This is where we learn a little about you, and the kind of person you’re looking for. We want to make sure we pair you with someone who’s at the same stage of life as you, someone who shares common interests. At the end of the conversation, we will be able to tell you if we think we have the right people to introduce you to. You can then walk away and make your own decision in your own time."
