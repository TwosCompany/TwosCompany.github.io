description: "Two’s Company owner, Sasha Madarasz, previously ran NZ’s busiest talent agency, creating opportunities for people on TV and in Film & Modelling work. This paved the way for Two’s Company, after seven years of matching people to briefs. Passionate about starting her own business, Sasha’s partner suggested she start a dating agency. She loved the idea. 'I researched what people loved about the current agencies, what they hated and opened Two’s Company using those answers.' And so, Two’s Company was born."
