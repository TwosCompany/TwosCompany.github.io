description: "Sasha previously ran NZ's busiest talent agency, putting people on TV, film, & photographic work. It was full on work and matching people to a brief. She did this for six years before deciding she wanted her own business. It was her partner at the time that suggested opening a dating agency at which she thought, 'That's a great idea. I researched what people loved about the current agencies, what they hated and opened Two's Company using those answers.'"
