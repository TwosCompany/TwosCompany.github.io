name: "WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR CLIENTS NEED MORE THAN THE FIRST 4 INTRODUCTIONS BEFORE MEETING SOMEONE THEY WISH TO PURSUE A RELATIONSHIP WITH?"
description: "Giving a percentage is hard. As long as the clients are happy with the quality of people they are being introduced to they will keep meeting people until they have met the one. Two's Company introduces you to people that fit the brief we talk about at our first initial meeting (more on that later.) Then after a few dates of getting to know each other, if there is chemistry between the two people, great! If not, then we will look at the next introduction. I don't think anyone can foresee chemistry - it's up to the two people involved, so, trial and error. If you have not met 'the one' in the first 4 introductions - you can choose to have 3 more introductions at $150. Obviously you would only do this if you were happy with the standard of the first 4 people we introduced you to. Our job is to give people the opportunity to meet other single people who are looking for the same things. The rest is up to them."
