name: "HOW OFTEN DO CLIENTS NEED MORE THAN 4 INTRODUCTIONS BEFORE MEETING SOMEONE THEY WANT TO CONTINUE WITH?"
description: "Putting a figure on it isn’t easy. No one can predict chemistry, so as long as you are happy with the calibre and quality of the people we are introducing you to, then we can keep going until you meet “the one”. We introduce you to people who fit as much of your initial brief as possible, then after a few dates we might finesse your profile, or you may have found a great match. If you have not met “the one” after your first four introductions, we can organise three more introductions for a small fee."
