name: "CAN I PUT MY MEMBERSHIP ON HOLD, AND COME BACK LATER?"
description: "Absolutely! There’s no time limit on your membership and its fine for you to go ‘on hold’ for any reason, at any time. Take the example of the first person we introduce you to; you may have a two year relationship, and if that comes to a close, we’ll re-activate your profile for another three matches. If your employer decides to send you to Asia for six months, easy – we’ll just put your profile on hold. The joining fee is a one time payment and entitles you to four introductions, no time limit."
