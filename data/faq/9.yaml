name: "OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME CAN YOU USE THE INTRODUCTIONS?"
description: "There is no time limit at all for the clients and they can put their membership on hold at any time. For example, if the first person we introduced you to, you had a two year relationship with, but that ended, then you would come back on the books. If work decided to send you to South America for six months - just put us on hold! You have no time limit what so ever. You never pay the joining fee again. The contract states that Two's Company has 12 months to fulfill its obligation of 4 introductions, however, Two's Company gives the client as long as they like to take all 4 Introductions. There is no yearly fee - no renewal fee - you never pay the joining fee again. "
