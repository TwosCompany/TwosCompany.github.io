description: "We ask for about 1 - 2 weeks from initial sign up. You have only 4 introductions at this stage and we want them to be as spot on as possible. This is definitely a quality not quantity service. We would rather give it a couple more weeks than introduce you to someone who does not match your brief and vice versa. "
