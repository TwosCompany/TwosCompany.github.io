name: "WHAT IS OUR SUCCESS RATE?"
description: "To date, we are responsible for over 50 marriages and well over 300 couples who are now in long term relationships. It’s a tricky number to keep track of, but it’s a great feeling knowing we’ve successfully matched so many people already. We only take on clients who we can guarantee introductions for, and we will turn away people if we do not have the right people to introduce them to. We stand by our name when it comes to introducing good, single people. We check in after first dates, and have a 90% success rate for first time meetings. This means that 90% of feedback after a first date is positive. There may be no match there, but the client has agreed with who we have introduced them to. Our clients stand by our matching excellence."
