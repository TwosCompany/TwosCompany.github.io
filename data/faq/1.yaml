name: "WHAT IS OUR SUCCESS RATE?"
description: "The answer to this question is two fold. Firstly we have at this stage (2014) about 33 marriages that we know of and about 160 couples that are still in relationships who we have introduced. Again, this is only what we know of, we suspect the number to be higher for both cases. Secondly we only take on clients who we know we have people to introduce them to. We turn away people who we don't have the right matches for. What we guarantee once we have said we can take you on, is that we can give you the opportunity to meet good single people. We cannot guarantee chemistry or attraction. We are the only agency to do follow up after every first date. If you can say to us on the follow up 'nice person, I can see why you introduced us' then that is counted as a success as that's all we can promise. So going on that formula our success rate is in the 90%."
