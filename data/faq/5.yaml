name: "WHAT ARE OUR POINTS OF DIFFERENCE?"
description: "* We are the most selective dating agency in NZ, and we will only take you on as a client if we have the right people to introduce you to. 
* We are the only agency to do follow-ups after every first date. 
* We are the only agency to offer a refund policy. 
* We meet at a cafe close to where you work so you don't need to take two hours off work for travel, parking and the meeting. The meeting itself is usually 45-60 minutes. 
* We are not a date a week agency - The agent will tell you at the sign up how frequent the introductions should be. 
* We meet with every single client who wishes to join and check photo I.D 
* The matching is not computer generated - it is all done by hand."
