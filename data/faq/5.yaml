name: "WHAT ARE OUR POINTS OF DIFFERENCE?"
description: "* We are NZ’s most selective dating agency, and only take on clients we know we can match. 
* We’re the only agency to catch up with you for feedback after every first date. 
* We’re the only agency to offer a refund policy. (See contract for details)
* We meet at a cafe close to you, so you don’t need to take two hours off work. The meeting usually takes 45-60 minutes.
* We believe in quality. We are not a date-a-week style agency.
* We meet with every single client who wishes to join and check photo I.D. No exceptions.
* We do not match by computer - it is all done by hand, instinct, common sense and  years of experience."
