name: "IS YOUR CLIENT BASE APPROXIMATELY 50/50 MALE AND FEMALE?"
description: "Our clients are aged between 25 to late 70â€™s with the majority being between 25-50. The 55+ age group is a problem area for us, with more women approaching the agency than men. This means we have to limit the number of women who we can take on in the 55+ age group to match the number of men. We do this case by case and still meet with everyone who is interested in learning more about how we work."
