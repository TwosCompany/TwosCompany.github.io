name: "IS YOUR CLIENT BASE APPROXIMATELY 50/50 MALE AND FEMALE?"
description: "We start at 27 and our oldest clients are early 70's. The 30 - 50 age group is where we are the busiest, the most balanced and therefore have the most success. Our problem area is the 55+ age group as we have more women approach the agency than we do men. Therefore we turn away a lot if women in the 55+ age group - purely so we can keep a balance of men and women. It breaks my heart but it has to be done to be fair to those already on the books. However we still meet with everyone who wishes to join and let them know if we have the right people to introduce them to at the end of the meeting."
