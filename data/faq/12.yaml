name: "IF THE INTRODUCTION DOES NOT RESULT IN A RELATIONSHIP, IS THERE A FOLLOW UP SO YOU KNOW WHY AND WILL BE ABLE TO 'FINE TUNE' THE SELECTION PROCESS?"
description: "We are the only Agency in NZ who do follow ups after every first date. These are to make sure you are happy with who we are choosing to introduce you to. We do give advice, however at the same time we can not pass on any feedback with out the other persons permission. The general feedback we get is, 'Nice person, not sure, but we are going to have another date'. "
