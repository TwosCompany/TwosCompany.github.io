description: "Yes, in fact we’re the only agency in New Zealand who follow up after every first date. These check ins are to make sure you’re happy with who we are choosing to introduce you to. We do give advice, but at the same time we can’t pass on feedback without the other person’s permission. Generally we enjoy very positive feedback."
