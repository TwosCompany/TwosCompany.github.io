text: "Thanks to your careful and inspired match-making, B.C and I have stayed together and have gone from strength to strength since our first chat in August 2012. I wanted to personally thank you for setting us up. If it wasn’t for you we wouldn’t have moved in together a year later, or got engaged on our trip to Vanuatu in August last year, and we wouldn’t have been married in Russell in October last year. This is truly a very happy ending for both of us thanks to you and Two’s Company."
