Timing is everything. Before Xmas, I was overwhelmed with so many deadlines so I let M.P go because I didn't have the bandwidth for him as well. But over the Xmas break, I realised I missed his company and now we are all ON again!
I can see what a fickle world you work in and I admire your patience. Wrangling the whims of men and women as they find each other........One of the things he said to me was 'don't throw the baby out with the bath water' at the time when I said it wasn't going anywhere. He was absolutely right -  I was too stressed with all the other demands on my time and he was just one more thing to fit in. But when that settled, I realised we are a really good match. 
I think that you are also absolutely right in saying that you can't possibly make a judgement about someone after one date. The second date is crucial, but so is making time for that person, and allowing yourself to be 'present' in that time. It is very interesting how one judges someone else based on all the old habits and biases, but when you take the time, there are real nuggets of gold there."
