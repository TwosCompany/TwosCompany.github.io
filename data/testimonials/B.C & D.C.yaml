text: "Thanks to your careful and inspired match-making, B.C and I have stayed together and have gone from strength to strength since our first chat in August 2012. I wanted to personally thank you for setting us up. If it wasn’t for you we wouldn’t have moved in together a year later, or got engaged on our trip to Vanuatu in August last year, and we wouldn’t have been married in Russell in October last year. We took a leaf out of your book and quietly eloped to the beautiful Bay of Islands, only our very close family knew. We had such an incredibly happy weekend full of love and blessings. This is truly a very happy ending for both of us thanks to you and Two’s Company."
