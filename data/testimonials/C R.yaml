I honestly didn't think it was possible to find someone as well suited for me as she is so I cannot thank you enough for bringing us together! Have a wonderful holiday season and a spectacular new year! Keep up the great work, I'll be recommending you to all the single people I know! :-)
And later . . .
As a wee thank you and to keep the spirit of Christmas giving alive C.R and I have made a donation to the Auckland Cancer Society on your behalf. We are so very grateful for what you have done for us and we cannot thank you enough! :-) Enjoy your break!"
