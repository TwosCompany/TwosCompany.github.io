We have been together for 5 months since our first date on 1 Dec, and things have been going so well that we are about to move in together permanently.  We were both a bit jaded with dating so had no great expectations when we met for our first date.  It became clear early on that we had an easy connection and we spent a lot of time talking and laughing while we got to know each other in those early stages.  Thank-you so much for matching us during your Monday morning match-making sessions lol We have very similar ideas and values about lifestyle, work and family, and share a healthy sense of humour. 
Weâ€™re both looking forward to the next stage of our relationship which has been going from strength to strength."
