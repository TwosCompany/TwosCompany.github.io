                        <p>Hi Sasha The date with P.T went well last night, and we talked lots ( We were the last to leave the restaurant!!). Hopefully she felt the same way, and we can meet up again for another date. We got on very well, and conversation flowed freely, and it would be lovely to get to know her a little better, and to see where it takes us&hellip;. We have a lot of similar ideas and values, and both enjoy long walks. She is a lovely intelligent lady, and thank you for the opportunity to meet her</p>

                        <p>Just thought I would let you know how things are going with J.P and I. We have been together for 5 months since our first date on 1 Dec, and things have been going so well that we are about to move in together permanently.  We were both a bit jaded with dating so had no great expectations when we met for our first date.  It became clear early on that we had an easy connection and we spent a lot of time talking and laughing while we got to know each other in those early stages.  Thank-you so much for matching us during your Monday morning match-making sessions lol We have very similar ideas and values about lifestyle, work and family, and share a healthy sense of humour. We’re both looking forward to the next stage of our relationship which has been going from strength to strength.</p>

                        <p>Good Afternoon Sasha, L.S is amazing! He ticks all the boxes and I couldn’t be happier :) Things are going really well and I can see a beautiful future for us. It’s still early days but I’ve developed really strong feelings for him already. Thank you, thank you, thank you for introducing us.</p>

We’ve been living here now for a couple of months &amp; all is going well.  He’s doing well adjusting to living with a teenager again &amp; looking after a demanding cat &amp; dog.  Our families get on well &amp; are happy for us which is great. So thanks so much for introducing us!! I don’t think either of us imagined we’d end up together when we first met but we persevered &amp; are now very happy.</p>

                        <p>Hi Sasha First of all I must compliment you on your matching skills, pretty awesome,  H.W is a lovely lady and I could not be happier, if it works out it would be great, if it doesn&rsquo;t at least I have had the privilege of meeting and spending some time with such a special person. I have personally been through a pretty stressful end of a relationship and H.W even though we have only known each other for a few months has bought a lot of much needed happiness into my life, and is also helping me move on with my life.
I could not rate your service more highly.</p>

We would never have found each other if it wasn’t for Twos Company  - completely different circles.  Really appreciate the opportunity of putting us together! Many thanks.</p>

                        <p>I thought I would update you yet again as I have recommended your service to several people after my recent success! Timing is everything. Before Xmas, I was overwhelmed with so many deadlines so I let M.P go because I didn&rsquo;t have the bandwidth for him as well. But over the Xmas break, I realised I missed his company and now we are all ON again! I can see what a fickle world you work in and I admire your patience. Wrangling the whims of men and women as they find each other&hellip;&hellip;..One of the things he said to me was &lsquo;don&rsquo;t throw the baby out with the bath water&rsquo; at the time when I said it wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere. He was absolutely right -  I was too stressed with all the other demands on my time and he was just one more thing to fit in. But when that settled, I realised we are a really good match. I think that you are also absolutely right in saying that you can&rsquo;t possibly make a judgement about someone after one date. The second date is crucial, but so is making time for that person, and allowing yourself to be &lsquo;present&rsquo; in that time. It is very interesting how one judges someone else based on all the old habits and biases, but when you take the time, there are real nuggets of gold there.</p>

                        <p>Hi Sasha, It&rsquo;s been a while since I have written to you. W.K and I are still going strong, and guess what?!! We are expecting our first baby! We moved pretty fast, but when it&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s right&hellip; The baby is only 11 weeks, so fingers crossed for us that this is a healthy pregnancy. Thank you for finding me this man, we wouldn&rsquo;t have met any other way.</p>

                        <p>Hi Sasha, Well D.S and I are getting on very well, caught up again last weekend and had a cool relaxing day together. So far I reckon your match making on this could be spot on, and it seems the feeling is mutual. So at this stage please put me in your on hold file, while we see where this goes.Thanks for the introduction.</p>

                        <p>Hi Sasha, I wanted to send an update on how things are going with W.K. We moved in together and have been living together for about 2 and half months.  Things are going really well and I&rsquo;m very happy. His family is amazing and I&rsquo;m totally in love.  Thank you for the introduction, he is just perfect.</p>

                        <p>Hi Sasha, Every relationship has its own story.In the case of C.I and I it has been a somewhat complicated and evolving tale. C.I said I had to write to you and thank Two&rsquo;s Company for introducings us.I know I can unreservedly say we delight in each others company and share a wide and growing range of interests and like to spend as much time as possible together. What else can I say;We are very happy. Yes! we would both recommend Twos Company to friends and complement you for allowimg people in more far flung regions to have plenty of opportunity to communicate well before meeting. Thankyou again Sasha and also Roisin,</p>

                        <p>Thanks for checking in. I have some exciting news to share actually. You introduced me to J.I nearly a year ago now and we are living together very happily and have just got engaged. You did an excellent job matching the two of us - we are a perfect fit! I&rsquo;m looking forward to a lifetime of love and laughter with her. Thank you very much for putting us in touch, my world is immeasurably brighter with her by my side!</p>

                        <p>C.R is amazing! We are going very well and are looking forward to spending a lovely Christmas together with our two little boys. Thankfully they get on just as well as we do! I honestly didn&rsquo;t think it was possible to find someone as well suited for me as she is so I cannot thank you enough for bringing us together! Have a wonderful holiday season and a spectacular new year! Keep up the great work, I&rsquo;ll be recommending you to all the single people I know! :-) And later &hellip; As a wee thank you and to keep the spirit of Christmas giving alive C.R and I have made a donation to the Auckland Cancer Society on your behalf. We are so very grateful for what you have done for us and we cannot thank you enough! :-) Enjoy your break!</p>

                        <p>Yes, we&rsquo;re still together and everything is going exceptionally well. Been out lots on his jetski, he&rsquo;s met my little man and they have really bonded well together. He&rsquo;s such a kind and caring person and we have lots of fun together. Here&rsquo;s hoping we can go the mile and last a lifetime. I would really love that! We have both said that we would have paid double the price for your services considering how we both feel right now, possibly that&rsquo;s something you need to consider!! :-)</p>

                        <p>Thanks to your careful and inspired match-making, B.C and I have stayed together and have gone from strength to strength since our first chat in August 2012. I wanted to personally thank you for setting us up. If it wasn’t for you we wouldn’t have moved in together a year later, or got engaged on our trip to Vanuatu in August last year, and we wouldn’t have been married in Russell in October last year. We took a leaf out of your book and quietly eloped to the beautiful Bay of Islands, only our very close family knew. We had such an incredibly happy weekend full of love and blessings. This is truly a very happy ending for both of us thanks to you and Two’s Company.</p>
