      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you single and getting a bit lonely? Well what a better time to get to know someone than in lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously we can&amp;rsquo;t actually meet potential lovers in person just yet but thanks to the internet and video calling apps we&amp;rsquo;re still able to interact with those outside our bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give us the rules and guidelines on online dating is Two&amp;rsquo;s Company Owner Sasha Madarasz spoke to The AM Show.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sasha Madarasz has been interviewed on the Paul Henry show. Not only are we in the midst of the great Kiwi man drought, there&amp;rsquo;s an education gap to boot between the few available men and their higher-qualified female counterparts looking for love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Younger people more attracted to dating agencies</title>
      <link>http://twoscompany.co.nz/press/nzheraldvalentines/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tinder has become a slippery slope into dating agencies for the younger crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years ago around 20 people under 30 were looking for love through dating agency Two&amp;rsquo;s Company. Now that number hovers around 80.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agency director Sasha Madarasz spoke to the Herald ahead of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day this Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last five years, Madarasz had seen a huge shift in younger people using dating agencies. Most of her clients used to be in the 37 to 55 age range, now they&amp;rsquo;re in the 25 to 40 age range.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of running a talent agency, Sasha Madarasz felt ready to get out of the fast-paced film industry and make more of a difference in the world. She just didn’t know how she would do that. The answer came from her boyfriend at the time, who suggested she start a dating agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Go On A Date Think Like A Matchmaker</title>
      <link>http://twoscompany.co.nz/press/go-on-a-date-think-like-a-matchmaker/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today more than ever it is so easy to meet people from all around the world without leaving your doorstep. When online dating became available there was hope that finding love would be a brief and brisk affair. Unfortunately the opposite occurred. Finding and recognizing true love has turned out to be a much more challenging journey, more than it was in our parents’ generation. The growing number of singles in our modern society proves this sad reality. Becoming aware of this situation, I thought it would be interesting to hear advice from professional matchmakers from different countries who have proven success in their field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;They want Kiwis&amp;rsquo;
Sasha Madarasz, 42, set up dating agency Two&amp;rsquo;s Company 13 years ago to a booming industry. She said it used to just be the 50+ age bracket who were using her match-making skills but &amp;gt; now she&amp;rsquo;s getting people as young as 23 asking to be set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The age bracket that&amp;rsquo;s booming is the 25 to 45 range. In the past five years, or even three, it&amp;rsquo;s really skyrocketed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
