In the last five years, Madarasz had seen a huge shift in younger people using dating agencies. Most of her clients used to be in the 37 to 55 age range, now they&amp;rsquo;re in the 25 to 40 age range.</description>

The growing number of singles in our modern society proves this sad reality.</description>
