      <description>Are you single and getting a bit lonely? Well what a better time to get to know someone than in lockdown.
Obviously we can&amp;rsquo;t actually meet potential lovers in person just yet but thanks to the internet and video calling apps we&amp;rsquo;re still able to interact with those outside our bubble.
To give us the rules and guidelines on online dating is Two&amp;rsquo;s Company Owner Sasha Madarasz spoke to The AM Show.</description>

      <description>Tinder has become a slippery slope into dating agencies for the younger crowd.
Five years ago around 20 people under 30 were looking for love through dating agency Two&amp;rsquo;s Company. Now that number hovers around 80.
Agency director Sasha Madarasz spoke to the Herald ahead of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day this Wednesday.
In the last five years, Madarasz had seen a huge shift in younger people using dating agencies. Most of her clients used to be in the 37 to 55 age range, now they&amp;rsquo;re in the 25 to 40 age range.</description>

      <description>Today more than ever it is so easy to meet people from all around the world without leaving your doorstep. When online dating became available there was hope that finding love would be a brief and brisk affair. Unfortunately the opposite occurred. Finding and recognizing true love has turned out to be a much more challenging journey, more than it was in our parents’ generation. The growing number of singles in our modern society proves this sad reality.</description>

      <title>WHAT WOMEN WANT</title>
      <link>http://twoscompany.co.nz/press/14.-what-women-want/</link>

      <guid>http://twoscompany.co.nz/press/14.-what-women-want/</guid>
      <description>For time immemorial men have been asking one question; one BIG question; &amp;ldquo;What do women want?!!!&amp;quot; There have been many books and even movies written in an attempt to answer this question. However if you have ever found yourself wondering what women are really looking for, more likely than not all the books written exploring this subject are by American authors for Americans.
In my 14 years of running Two&amp;rsquo;s Company, an introduction agency for busy Kiwi’s, it has become clear to me that Kiwi women and men are worlds away from their American counterparts.</description>

      <description>This may seem like a funny time to be meeting new people, however it might just be the perfect time.
Keeping safe doesn’t have to mean being isolated. No, we are not allowed to leave our bubble, but if you are single and wanting to meet someone, it can still happen.
As my clients know, I am big on people not judging someone after one date. We have a two date ‘encouragement’ because this gives you time to get to know someone.</description>
